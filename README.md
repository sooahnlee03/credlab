In the recent years, we have seen a rise in more brands utilizing TikTok as a marketing platform, especially in the beauty industry to target Gen Z consumers and reach a wider audience. Some studies have conducted on this marketing strategy between brands and influencers, but not much has been done computationally in large scale to understand the relationship between the two parties.

The concept of “tradwives,” short for traditional wives, has recently gained a large
traction on TikTok, where curated videos showcasing idealized, and often unattainable,
portrayals of motherhood dominate For You Pages. These portrayals frequently reinforce
unrealistic expectations for mothers who do not conform to the privileged and romanticized
image presented. Some possible factors that contribute to the appeal of these videos is the
meticulously crafted aesthetic of their homes, coupled with distinctive fashion choices that often
deviate from mainstream trends among younger women.
